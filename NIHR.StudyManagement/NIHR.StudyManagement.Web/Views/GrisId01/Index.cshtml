            What is Government Research (GRIS) ID?
        </h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">The Government Research ID (GRIS ID) is a unique identifier that will be allocated to all
            new studies (even if they are sub-studies) when it is first logged in a system.

            The GRIS ID will be generated by the person who first creates the study record. This could be in a Local
            Portfolio Management System (LPMS), funding system or regulatory and ethics approvals system. Whilst the
            GRIS ID could be generated by an R&D Team, Sponsor, Research Study team member or someone associated with
            the research study team, it will be the responsibility of the Chief Investigator to share the GRIS ID with
            research study team members.</p>

            The aims of the GRIS ID includes the following
        </h3>

        <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
            <li>Enable data sharing across funding, LPMS and regulatory and ethical approvals systems</li>
            <li>To ensure consistent data standards and models are followed across these systems</li>
            <li>To ensure that the NIHR and DHSE are able to access and report on near real time data for all health and
                care research requiring HRA approval.</li>

            How it works?
        </h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            Each new study will be allocated a GRIS ID, and it will be in addition to IRAS, CPMS and funding IDs. It
            will be generated by the first system that the study is logged in. Research study teams and sponsors, and
            R&D teams will be able to link associated studies.

        <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
            <li>Auto-populating information that has previously been provided, i.e. where the same information is
                captured in multiple systems, the GRIS ID will capture and share the data between systems (e.g. from
                IRAS to the LPMS)</li>
            <li>Enabling a consolidated list of linked studies, e.g. platform / continuation studies, where studies have
                shared participants and where studies have related research outcomes and/or publications</li>
            <li>Listing points of contact for a given study and the linked team members.</li>
            <li>Allowing Research Study Teams, Sponsors and R&D Teams to track and manage amendments between linked
                studies and to capture how funding is allocated </li>
            <li>Ensuring there are no duplicate study records</li>
